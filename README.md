# HelloHost: Your Friendly Microservice Hosting Framework

## Philosophy
Provides a simple to extend basic microservices framework that is easy to extend, compose, and create with ai assistances.

In pursuit of these goals, we abide by the following principles:

- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: We believe that the complexity of code should not surpass the complexity of the problem it's solving. Our goal is to generate code that is as simple to explain as the real-world issue it tackles. 

- **Secure By Default**: Even at a small scale, we prioritize security to protect sensitive data and uphold user trust.

- **Resilience Matters**: We believe in the importance of resilience, and we incorporate basic error handling and recovery mechanisms in our framework.

- **Usability for Everyone**: With a user-friendly interface and clear, straightforward documentation, we make software development a breeze for everyone, even for non-tech-savvy individuals.

- **AI first apis**: Keep in mind who ai can take advantage of these interfaces first.

Here's how we do it:
