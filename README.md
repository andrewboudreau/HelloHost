# HelloHost: Your Friendly Microservice Hosting Framework

## Philosophy (or Mission)

At the heart of HelloHost, our mission is to make software development accessible, simple, and secure. We believe that anyone, regardless of their technical prowess, should be able to build applications with ease. We focus on making this process intuitive, and we strive to ensure that the tools we provide are understandable by everyone.

In pursuit of these goals, we abide by the following principles:

- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: We believe that the complexity of code should not surpass the complexity of the problem it's solving. Our goal is to generate code that is as simple to explain as the real-world issue it tackles. 

- **Secure By Default**: Even at a small scale, we prioritize security to protect sensitive data and uphold user trust.

- **Resilience Matters**: We believe in the importance of resilience, and we incorporate basic error handling and recovery mechanisms in our framework.

- **Usability for Everyone**: With a user-friendly interface and clear, straightforward documentation, we make software development a breeze for everyone, even for non-tech-savvy individuals.

## In-Depth: Simplifying Real-World Problems 

One of the core principles of HelloHost is the idea that the complexity of the code should not exceed the complexity of the problem it's trying to solve. Too often, we see software solutions that are harder to understand than the issues they address. This principle guides us to create tools that keep the complexity of generated code in check. Here's how we do it:
