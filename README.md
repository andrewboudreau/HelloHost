# HelloHost: Your Friendly Microservice Hosting Framework
## Mission
Use composable software components and event-driven design principles to extend and host ai-assisted services. AI is a first class participant in all aspects of the project design, documentation, development, extension, and composablity of the system should all be accessible using natural language models.

## Philosophy
One of the core principles of HelloHost is the idea that the complexity of the code should not exceed the complexity of the problem it's trying to solve. 

Too often, we see software solutions that are harder to understand than the issues they address. This principle guides us to create tools that keep the complexity of generated code in check. Here's how we do it:
In pursuit of these goals, we abide by the following principles:

- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: We believe that the complexity of code should not surpass the complexity of the problem it's solving. Our goal is to generate code that is as simple to explain as the real-world issue it tackles. Reduce complexity by not solving problems that are hard to explain.

- **Secure By Default**: Even at a small scale, we prioritize security to protect sensitive data and uphold user trust.

- **Resilience Matters**: We believe in the importance of resilience, and we incorporate basic error handling and recovery mechanisms in our framework.

- **Usability for Everyone**: With a user-friendly interface and clear, straightforward documentation, we make software development a breeze for everyone, even for non-tech-savvy individuals.

- **AI first APIs**: Keep in mind who ai can take advantage of these interfaces first.
